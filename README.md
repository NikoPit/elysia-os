# Elysia-OS

A desktop operating system written in Rust, without any software from the 1980's

## Progress

### ✅ Completed Features
- **Bootloader Integration**: Working boot process with bootloader crate
- **Memory Management**: Paging, heap allocation, and fixed block size allocator
- **Interrupt Handling**: Hardware interrupts, exceptions, and system call interface
- **Basic Drivers**: PS/2 keyboard, serial port (UART 16550), VGA text mode
- **Filesystem**: Virtual filesystem (VFS) with (very trashy) RAMFS implementation
- **Multitasking**: Async/await support with custom executor and task management
- **ACPI Support**: Basic ACPI table parsing and system discovery
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suites for various components

### 🚧 In Progress / Planned
- **FAT32 Filesystem**: Basic implementation exists but needs completion
- **User Space Programs**: Loading and executing ELF binaries
- **Process Management**: Proper process isolation and scheduling
- **Device Drivers**: More hardware support (storage, network, etc.)
- **Package Management**: Software installation and management system

### 📋 Future Goals
- **Networking Stack**: TCP/IP networking support
- **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU support and graphics acceleration

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- Rust nightly toolchain
- `bootimage` crate for creating bootable images
- QEMU for emulation

### Building
```bash
# Install bootimage
cargo install bootimage

# Build the OS
cargo build

# Build and run in QEMU
cargo run
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test suites
cargo test --test stack_overflow
cargo test --test multitask
cargo test --test filesystem
```
